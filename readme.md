This program is designed for Year 4 students with a guidance of teacher or a guardian 
to tell the users which button to choose and what to do.

Notes) the codes are quite repetitive so I have commented some part of code only once
in the very first one. Whenever the same line appears in the code, you can just go up
and find out what that specific line of code does.
